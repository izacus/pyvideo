class VideoFormat(object):
    '''Video details.

    An instance of this class is provided by sources with a video track.  You
    should not modify the fields.

    Note that the sample aspect has no relation to the aspect ratio of the
    video image.  For example, a video image of 640x480 with sample aspect 2.0
    should be displayed at 1280x480.  It is the responsibility of the
    application to perform this scaling.

    :Ivariables:
        `width` : int
            Width of video image, in pixels.
        `height` : int
            Height of video image, in pixels.
        `sample_aspect` : float
            Aspect ratio (width over height) of a single video pixel.
